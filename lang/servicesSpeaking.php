Yet executing on that disruption requires the learning and growth of your people. You know your people want to make progress, but don't always know how. Sometimes they don't know where to start. Once they start, they can struggle to maintain momentum, and once they've made considerable progress, they may tire of what they've been doing and need to do something new.",

What does it take to gain and maintain momentum once people start? And finally, why do people outgrow things so quickly? The answers to these questions prepare you to understand the growth process and identify where each person, including yourself, is in his/her growth.
