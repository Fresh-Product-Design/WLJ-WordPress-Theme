  <p class="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-6">Step Back to Grow</p>
  <p class="text-[#4d4d4d]">Our path toward growth is not linear or predictable. Sometimes the best step forward is a step sideways (e.g., lateral move to a new department), back, (e.g., returning to a previous position with new responsibilities), or down (e.g., taking a lower status job to learn new skillls). Also, taking time to pause can both increase productivity and overall well-being.</p>
