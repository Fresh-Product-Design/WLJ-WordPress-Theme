  <p class="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-6">Step Back to Grow</p>
  <p class="text-[#4d4d4d]">Our path toward growth is not linear or predictable. Sometimes the best step toward growth is a step sideways (e.g., lateral move to a new department), back (e.g., returning to a previous position with new capacities), or down (e.g., taking a lower status job to learn new skills). Cultivating practices of reflection in our lives can help us be open to growth opportunities away from the expected path that empower our long-term growth.</p>
