Her wise counsel and smart pragmatism helped me hit the ground running, and she has been a wonderful sounding board since then on a whole range of issues. In terms of my personal growth, I have easily experienced a ten-fold return on my investment. I leave all of our interactions grateful for the opportunity I have to work with her.</p>
