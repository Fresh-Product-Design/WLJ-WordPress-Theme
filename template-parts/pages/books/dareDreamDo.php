      <p class="text-[#4d4d4d] mb-4">We can each achieve greater happiness when focusing both on our dreams and on other people in our lives.</p>
      <p class="text-[#4d4d4d] mb-4">In this inspiring book, Whitney Johnson directs her attention to teaching women, in particular, a three-step model for personal advancement and happiness. She first encourages us to DARE to boldly step out, to consider disrupting life as we know it. Then she teaches us how to DREAM, to give life to the many possibilities available, whether to start a business, run a marathon, or travel the world. Finally, Whitney's model brings out the businesswoman in her; she teaches us to DO, to execute our dreams. Rich with real stories of women who have dared todream, DARE, DREAM, DO offers a practical framework to realize one's true potential.</p>
      <p class="text-[#4d4d4d] mb-8">In her mid-twenties, Whitney found herself in New York, where she landed a secretarial job on Wall Street. Through determination and hard work, Whitney became an investment banker, moving to the analyst side of the business, executing the plans she'd laid out for herself. Naively, she thought most women were following similar paths until she started talking and found that many women were not daring to dream at all. DARE, DREAM, DO is full of remarkable stories of real people realizing their dreams, which will no doubt inspire others to follow suit.</p>
