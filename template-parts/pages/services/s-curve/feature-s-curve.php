  <p class="text-lg mb-6">The S Curve of Learning models personal growth: what you most important goals are, and the progress you are making toward achieving them. Every new skill learned, every challenge taken, takes the form of a distinct learning curve. You can pinpoint where you are in the growth process; you can determine what your next step needs to be. You can use this model to self-direct your growth; you can use it to help others grow.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-10">Whether in your career, in your team members, in your organization, or your personal lifeâ€”your growth journey can be visualized as a rising S-shaped curve (like a wave) with three broad categories:</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-[#4d4d4d]">This is where individuals are enjoying the challenge, where things are hard, but not too hard, and easy, but not too easy. Momentum is maintained through focus. Growth is and feels fast.</p>
