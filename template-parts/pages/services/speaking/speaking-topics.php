        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-[#4d4d4d]">Consider this simple yet powerful idea: disruptive companies and ideas upend markets by doing something truly different. They see a need, an empty space waiting to be filled, and they dare to create something for which a market may not yet exist. Yet executing on that disruption requires the learning and growth of your people. You know your people want to make progress, but don't always know how. Sometimes they don't know where to start. Once they start, they can struggle to maintain momentum, and once they've made considerable progress, they may tire of what they've been doing and need to do something new.</p>
          <p class="text-[#4d4d4d]">In this keynote, you'll learn how to use the S Curve of Learning&trade; Framework to identify where you and each member of your team is in their growth and how to help them navigate their growth––from the launch point to sweet spot to mastery. The fundamental unit of growth is the individual. Companies don't disrupt, people do. </p>

        <p class="text-[#4d4d4d]">The most important funding mechanism for your company's growth is the learning and growth of your people. But somehow jobs muffle people's innate desire to learn––they find themselves bored, stagnant, or wanting more at work. In this keynote, you will learn about the S Curve of Learning&trade;, a model for smart growth. We will answer questions like, why, despite the desire to grow, can it be so difficult to start? What does it take to gain and maintain momentum once people start? And finally, why do people outgrow things so quickly? The answers to these questions prepare you to understand the growth process and identify where each person, including yourself, is in his/her growth. When you know where people are on their S Curves, you can help and support them as they move forward. Grow yourself to grow your people to grow your company. That's smart growth.</p>

        <p class="text-[#4d4d4d]">The secret to building a high-performing team is to have a plan for developing each employee no matter where they are on their personal learning curves. In this keynote, you will learn about the S Curve of Learning&trade; Framework and to identify where you and each member of your team is in their growth and then help them navigate their growth––from the launch point to the sweet spot to mastery.</p>
        <p class="text-[#4d4d4d]">Your team is a collection of S Curves. You build a team that can carry the high load of growth by building a portfolio of individual S Curves that matches your organization's current needs. When you help each person navigate the entire growth cycle––help them learn, leap and repeat––it is impossible not to gain an organizational advantage. Don't build just one A Team, build vast networks of A Teams across companies, careers, and lives.</p>
